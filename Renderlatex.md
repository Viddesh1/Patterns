Apparently you can render latex expression as a markdown file 


**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality** 

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$


Now, Don't ask me about what does this mathematical expression actually means, i don't know i just copied the expression from the gorhub docs for rendering the latex

i just want to see how does the latex works and does it supports rendering functionality or not.
